			longDescription:
				'A lyrics input support tool for vocalist melody scores (so-called "melo-fu") that can be surprisingly time-consuming when done carefully. It\'s designed to convert existing kanji-mixed lyric cards into hiragana & katakana suitable for melody scores, which can then be imported into score creation software like Sibelius, Finale, and MuseScore. It\'s particularly useful with software that has continuous lyric input functionality with space separation. We\'ve also added features like "は"↔"わ" conversion, which is useful for Vocaloid and AI singer production.',

Following Dropbox specifications, it modifies NTFS alternate file streams on Windows and extended attributes on MacOS/Linux. The file contents themselves are not changed, but please use at your own risk. Also, while the source code supports Linux, Dropbox testing has been minimal, so Linux users should build it themselves.
